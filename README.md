# Challenges and Learnings :books:
The Where's Asterix app provided me with a great opportunity to learn more about the back end in the form of Firebase. At first, I found using Firebase for the backend challenging due to the many services they provide, as well as the multiple setup procedures required. However, online research(stack overflow, firebase docs), and building a precursor chat app using firebase, provided me with the knowledge and confidence to complete this app. The skills I saw an improvement in were my UI design skills, my application of Typescript, and my use of async functions and promsises.          

### Future Features
